## Things accomplished in the project

- learning the theory, math involved and reviewing relevant publications (including advisor's previous works).
- understanding the new challenges involved in calculating interband transitions as opposed to intraband transitions (namely - working in k-space due to anisotropy of the bands).
- recreating past emission results for intraband emission both in equilibrium (BB) and in non-equilibrium settings in energy space.
- performing similar calculations, now in k - space and comparing results.
- realizing error in approach and understanding the need to make an approximation for the delta function (energy conservation).
- understanding when both numerical and analytical approximations converge to desired relative error.
# Things to be accomplished in the project

- need to fully realize the criteria for the conversion of delta-function approximation when performing k-space calculations.
- when the above is met, continue to performing the desired interband calculations - these, under non-equilibrium conditions will be constitute new (and hopefully interesting) contributions.
